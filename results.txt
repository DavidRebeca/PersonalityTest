Some might consider you naive and shy. You are not really interested in what is happening around you. The only people you really care about are your friends and family. You like the relationships you already have and the idea of meeting new people doesn't delight you.
You have a lot of original ideas. Unfortunately, you think that only your ideas are worth putting into practice. However, your exuberance helps you overcome anything!
You like to always be the center of attention. You are full of energy and people want to be around them to bring a good mood. You are a convinced optimist who always sees the glass half full!
You don't care about anything at all. You always do what you want without caring what other people would say. You are creative and you like to be alone.
You do your best to be the center of attention even if you don't see yourself face to face with others. Be careful who you mess with! If you don't like people you would call friends, you should look elsewhere.
